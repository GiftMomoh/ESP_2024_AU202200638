                <h3>Story 1</h3>
                <p>This is the story of how Ruby, a German Shephard found her forever home. 
                <br>We found Ruby by the roadside one rainy day, frail and shivering from the cold and we took her in.She was with us for quite a while as she was a very mischeivious dog.A lot of families adopted her but brought her back as they found her too much to handle, some even said "Get rid of this wild beast,noone will ever adopt her" but we kept her and raised her until a navy seal who was going away for a while adopted aand trained her for his wife and children.<br>Now, Ruby still lives with the family and is quite protective of them especially the children.</p>
